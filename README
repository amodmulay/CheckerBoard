Fun project to solve a problem:

On a 15x15 square you'll find a beetle on each square initially. When a bird approaches all beetles panic and jump to a random adjacent square. Beetles sitting on an edge square won't jump off the checkerboard. 

The bird approaches 100 times as he's really hungry. 

Show us the board after the 25., 50. and 100. approach with 
- the number of beetles per square 
- the average number of beetles per occupied square 
- the square(s) with the highest beetle population
